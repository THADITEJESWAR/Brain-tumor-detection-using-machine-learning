"Empowering Healthcare with Advanced Brain Tumor Detection"

"We leverage a diverse dataset of brain tumor images and non-tumor images to train a machine learning model for brain tumor detection. This model employs advanced algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze medical images and accurately predict the presence or absence of brain tumors, thus enabling early and reliable diagnosis of neurological conditions."
